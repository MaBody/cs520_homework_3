# hw1- Manual Review

The homework will be based on this project named "Expense Tracker",where users will be able to add/remove daily transaction. 

## New Functionality 
Our application now supports undo operations for added transactions. After selecting a transaction by clicking on a row in the UI table, the user can click the "undo" button to remove that transaction. The change is reflected immediately.

Furthermore, we have added test cases which cover the most important functional requirements.

## Compile

To compile the code from terminal, use the following command:
```
cd src
javac ExpenseTrackerApp.java
java ExpenseTracker
```

You should be able to view the GUI of the project upon successful compilation. 

## Java Version
This code is compiled with ```openjdk 17.0.7 2023-04-18```. Please update your JDK accordingly if you face any incompatibility issue.
